# Assignment 5
- Update all header and footers. Look at other websites and see what is normally in those. Don't forget there are two headers (public/private)

- Implement some components from Bootstrap (toasts, alerts, different nav, etc. See this: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components)

- Create an admin user (username: admin, password: admin)

- Once logged in, they can run various reports at /reports (hint: that's the controller name)

  - View all reminders

  - Who has the most reminders

  - How many total logins by username

  - Bonus: Implement a chart!

- Update header to include new menu item (only for admin user)

- Put in ACLs that do not allow a non-admin user and non-logged-in users to view the page

- All of the above will earn you 8/10. The last two can be earned by 1. Make your site look really good (CSS) without any errors. 2. Implement charts for the admin view. It's okay to use an existing JS library.
