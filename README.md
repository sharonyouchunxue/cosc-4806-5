# Assignment 4
- Allow a logged-in user to perform CRUD

- Create a reminder, view reminders (read), update existing reminders, and delete reminders

- The table should be called notes with at least 3 columns. Id, user_id, subject. You may want to add more such as: created_at, completed, deleted

- Update header to include the new item for creating reminders

- Your Models may look very similar from student to student. Your controller as well to a certain extent. However, your views should all be unique. You need to display the notes/reminders in a user-friendly way and the user should be able to update/delete them as well. There also needs to be a way for them to create. This is all covered in the video above.
